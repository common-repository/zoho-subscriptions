== EMBED PAYMENT FORMS ==

You can embed your hosted payment pages from Zoho Billing by including the following **shortcode** while drafting (or editing) a page/post in WordPress:

<code>[zs plan_code="BASIC"]</code>

Copy and paste the shortcode above in WordPress' editor. Next, replace BASIC in the shortcode with your plan's actual Plan Code. You can see what your embedded hosted payment page looks like by previewing your page/post.

*Tip: You can find your plan's Plan Code by going to Zoho Billing > Product Catalog > Subscription Items. Select a product and copy the Plan Code for the plan whose hosted payment pages you'd like to embed.*

You can adjust the width of your embedded hosted payment page by specifying a custom width in the shortcode above. Here's how: 

<code>[zs plan_code="BASIC" width="600"]</code>

Replace 600 in the shortcode above with your required width. If you do not include the "width" parameter, the default width will be set as 700.
